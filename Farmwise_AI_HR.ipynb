      "    *   **Rationale:**  Evaluates understanding of REST API principles and practical implementation experience.\n",
      "    *   **Red Flags:**  Only knowing how to consume APIs, not design them.  Lack of awareness of security considerations (e.g., authentication, authorization).\n",

      "Analyzing Resume for Pranav...\n",
      "Okay, let's analyze Pranav P's resume against the FarmwiseAI Internship to FTE job description.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Structured Evaluation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Technical Skills Score (Max: 60): 50**\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   **Rationale:** Pranav demonstrates a solid understanding of Machine Learning, NLP, and data analytics.  He mentions TensorFlow, PyTorch, and experience with deploying models. He also mentions Next.js and React for some potential Full Stack work. The resume lacks explicit mention of Flutter or mobile app dev which brings down the score.  The specific details of the technologies used in their projects demonstrate a strong understanding of the practical applications of these tools,\n",
      "*   **Experience Score (Max: 20): 18**\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   **Rationale:**  The resume lists multiple internships, with increasingly complex responsibilities in machine learning and data analytics.  The Descpro experience is particularly relevant due to the focus on building and deploying AI solutions. The projects are well-described. The length of the internships are appropriate for the timing in his education.\n",
      "*   **Soft Skills Score (Max: 10): 9**\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   **Rationale:** Pranav highlights teamwork, communication, and problem-solving skills throughout the resume. The \"Collaboration & Communication\" bullet point directly addresses this.  The descriptions of their projects show initiative and the ability to drive projects to completion.\n",
      "*   **Education Score (Max: 10): 8**\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   **Rationale:** The resume shows a B.Tech in Computer Science with a specialization in AI/ML from a reputable institution (VIT). The CGPA of 7.90 is respectable.\n",
      "*   **Total Score (Sum of all categories): 85**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Interview Questions:**\n",

      "2.  \"Describe a time when you had to learn a new technology or skill quickly to complete a project. What was your approach, and what were the key challenges you faced?\"\n",
      "    *   **Red Flags:**  Inability to describe a situation where they learned quickly, difficulty articulating their learning process, or lack of problem-solving skills.\n",
      "3.  \"How do you prioritize tasks and manage your time when working on multiple projects simultaneously, especially when deadlines are tight?\"\n",
      "    *   **Red Flags:** Poor time management skills, inability to prioritize tasks, difficulty adapting to changing priorities.\n",
      "4.  \"Describe a situation where you had a disagreement with a team member. How did you handle the situation, and what was the outcome?\"\n",
      "    *   **Red Flags:** Blaming others, inability to compromise, poor communication skills, or a negative attitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "**General Red Flags (Beyond the specific question red flags):**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   Hesitation, lack of confidence, or an inability to clearly articulate their experience and skills.\n",
      "*   Overly relying on jargon without demonstrating a true understanding of the concepts.\n",
      "*   Inability to explain the rationale behind their decisions and technical choices.\n",
      "*   A tendency to exaggerate their accomplishments or take credit for the work of others.\n",
      "*   Not demonstrating curiosity or a genuine interest in the company and the role.\n",
